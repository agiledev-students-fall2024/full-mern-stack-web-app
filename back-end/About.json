    "content": "Hi, my name is Mohamed. I am a Sophomore majoring in Mathematics and Data Science. I am from the\n United Arab Emirates (UAE), specifically in the city of Abu Dhabi. One of my favorite things about\n my major is solving math problems, with coffee, while listening to a genre of my choice. It hits\n the right spot! In my free time, I love to hike. This is a picture of me at the Blue Mountains in \nAustralia, while taking a semester at NYU Sydney. I highly reccomend it!",
